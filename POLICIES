	§1.	Use proper naming common used in project. CamelCase, with Svd prefix for all custom ServeD classes required.
	§2.	User A usually wont (and rarely should) know everything about user B's work. (Share knowledge about what You did with rest of team! "man synergy")
	§3.	Your code should work first, no matter how awful it is. It's Your trouble to make it better and beautify it, and optimize.
	§4.	Optimize when code (or part of code/ module) is in production stage of development only.
	§5.	Stability is more important than performance, but we care about performance more than a bit.
	§6.	Git "master" branch, should always be production ready (testable, compilable).
	§7.	Be helpful for others. Be useful with Your knowlege. Share with your experience.
	§8.	Don't afraid to tell teammate that (s)he did wrong. Explain yourself, then goto: §9
	§9.	If you have right, then You're the winner. If your solution is better - we love you, let's use it.
	§10. Always use SvdConfig.systemTmpDir in destructive operations in tests/specs.
