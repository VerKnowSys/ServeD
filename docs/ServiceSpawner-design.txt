A. Launched for root as system service, event loops / watchers spawned as forks/ threads with user priviledges.
  I. (SS side)
    1. user fork/ thread running for each /Users/ANYUID directory.
    2. watches for /Users/ANYUID/.spawn_user_panel. If this file exists, spawn SvdUserBoot.

  II. (JDK side)
    1. touch /Users/ANYUID/.spawn_user_panel on user demand.


B. Launched for user.
  I. (SS side)
    0. Create file watcher for $HOME/SoftwareData. If new service added, create file watcher for that service.
    2. Create file watchers for $HOME/SoftwareData/Services.
    3. If $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.autostart exists, launch SvdService


C. Launching service "Service"
  I. (JDK side):
    0. touch $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.domain with value of user domain
    1. touch $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.start
    2. wait for $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.running to continue

  II. (SS side):
    0. read "Service.json" igniter, replace values:
        SERVICE_ROOT => obvious (one of two: /Software/Service by default or $HOME/Apps/Service)
        SERVICE_PREFIX => obvious: $HOME/SoftwareData/Service
        SERVICE_DOMAIN => read $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.domain
        SERVICE_ADDRESS => to resolved IP of SERVICE_DOMAIN
    1. launch cron jobs for service
    2. launch svdshell with Service
    3. remove $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.start
    4. redirect process outputs to $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.outputs
    5. touch $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.running

  III. (JDK side):
    1. continue work when $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.running is found
    2. (…) optionally read $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.outputs or do whatever is required


D. Stopping service "Service"
  I. (JDK side):
    1. close service connections (if any)
    2. touch $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.stop
  II. (SS side):
    0. stop service
    1. remove $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.running
    2. remove $HOME/SoftwareData/Service/.stop
