A) System wide assumptions:

	STABILITY STATES:
		- normal usage
		- suspicious
		- alert

	MEM - system memory usage
	CPU - system cpu usage
	IO  - system load
	SWAP - system swap usage
	

System wide constants:
	MEMLIMIT	=>	memory amount per system
	CPULIMIT	=>	number of cpu cores
	DISKLIMIT	=>	disk space available for system


System wide rules:
	 1. MEM usage	> 75%							=> admin alert
	 2. MEM usage	> 85%							=> app restart
	 3. IO load		> 10							=> admin alert
	 4. SWAP usage	> 20%							=> generate memory statistic usage, admin alert
	 5. SWAP usage	> 50%							=> check which app is using lots of RSS, inform user, restart app
	 6. CPU usage	>= CPULIMIT -10% in 10 minutes	=> check which app is generating load, admin alert
	 7. CPU usage	>= CPULIMIT -10% in 60 minutes	=> check which app is generating load, inform user of app
	 8. Disk usage	>= DISKLIMIT -50GiB				=> generate disk usage report, admin alert



B) User wide assumptions:
	
	RANGE OF TIME: (for working apps)
		|.. last 30 days ..|.. last 24 hours ..|.. last 60 minutes ..|.. last 60s ..|
		|   count average  |   count average   |  count average 	 | ... |

	DATA - specified range of time (logarithmic) of usages:
	DATA[mem] - memory usage in time
	DATA[cpu] - cpu usage in time
	

User wide rules (according to DATA):
	0. unless user app has amount of 5*60s records (or no usage records available) then don't apply rules on such app yet
	1. 60s app memory usage average > 140% overall usage					=> alert user, alert admin
	2. 10min Quota usage average > 120% overall usage (of app lifetime) 	=> alert user, alert admin
