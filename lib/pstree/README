PSTREE is a clone of the standard Linux pstree command, which displays
process information in a heirarchical fashion.   It builds and runs on
SLS linux, FreeBSD 4.4, FreeBSD 4.8, and MacOS 10.0.4.   Unlike the
standard pstree, it uses either sysctl() [macOS 10.0.4], kvm_getprocs()
[FreeBSD 4.?] or /proc [SLS linux] as needed.

PSTREE is free software;  it is released under a BSD-style license
that allows you to do as you wish with it as long as you don't attempt
to claim it as your own work.

To install pstree, do

	./configure.sh		(./configure.sh --help explains options)

	make

	make install		(as root)


If pstree needs to use sysctl() or kvm_getprocs() to read process
information, it will be installed as a setuid process to allow
it to read all of the process data.
